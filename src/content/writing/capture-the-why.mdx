There's a lot of noise right now about **"decision traces"** and **"context graphs."** Fancy words for a simple problem we've been ignoring for years.

We don't need new infrastructure. <Highlight>We've just been lazy.</Highlight>

<DecisionToggle />

## The problem is embarrassingly simple

Every tool we use captures what happened. Activity logs, audit trails, version history. We're swimming in **"what"** data.

But ask **"why the hell did we do that?"** six months later and everyone's scrambling through Slack threads, pinging people who've left the company, reconstructing context from memory.

The data was there. At the moment of decision, someone knew:
- Why this approach won
- What other options got shot down
- Who said yes
- What past decision made this okay

<Highlight>We just didn't save it.</Highlight> Not because we couldn't. Because no one asked us to.

## We already solved this for code

Engineers figured this out 20 years ago.

Git commit + PR description + linked issue = decision trace for code.

<CommitCompare />

Engineers who've been burned treat commit messages like documentation. Not because anyone forces them to. Because they've asked **"wait, why did we write it this way?"** one too many times.

<Highlight color="green">The code doesn't change. The context around it does.</Highlight>

## Now apply that thinking everywhere else

<FlipCards />

Same pattern. Just applied beyond code.

## So why hasn't this happened?

Two reasons.

Friction. In the moment, no one wants to fill out a **"reason"** field. They're busy. They'll do it later. <Highlight color="pink">They never do.</Highlight>

Incentives. Activity logs are easy to build. Check a compliance box, ship it. Decision traces take effort. You actually have to think.

## What changes now

AI agents fix both problems.

<AgentSimulation />

**No more friction.** The agent is already doing the work. It pulled data from 5 places, weighed options, got approval. Writing down why? That's just one more line. <Highlight color="green">Zero extra effort.</Highlight>

**Incentives finally align.** AI agents need past decisions to get smarter. If you never saved why exceptions were made, the agent can't learn when to make them. Bad data in, bad decisions out.

If you're building AI agents, you have a choice. Capture the why from day one, or end up with another pile of useless logs.

## The moat isn't the graph. It's the discipline.

You don't need fancy infrastructure to start. Just capture three things with every action:
- What happened
- Why
- Who approved

<DecisionForm />

A text field works. A simple schema works. <Highlight>The value isn't in the architecture. It's in having the data at all.</Highlight>

Six months from now, when someone asks **"why did we decide this?"**, you'll either have an answer or you won't.
